# Getting Started

<div class="aside">
<h3>To-Do List</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use the GitHub template repository to create the extension.</li>
  <li><em>Clone</em> the repository into your local extensions folder.</li>
</ul>
</div>

Creating a new extension requires creating a new subfolder under your extensions folder that contains at least a package.json file. You could create your extension folder from scratch, but it is not recommended to do so. [Twilio has created a template repository on GitHub](https://github.com/TwilioQuest/twilioquest-extension-template) that should be used as a starting point.

## Working on your extension locally

When you've created your own copy of this template repo, clone your new repository into the extensions folder you specified in the game client when you enabled extensions.

Creating a TwilioQuest extension will require that you have [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.
